#Ocean Depletion Factors Dashboard

Overview

The Ocean Depletion Factors Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to visualize the impact of various environmental factors, such as CO2 levels, water temperature, and chemical contamination, on ocean depletion across different regions. The dashboard integrates data analytics and 3D plotting, allowing users to explore the correlation between these critical factors in a dynamic and user-friendly interface. The application provides both a 3D interactive visualization and data filtering capabilities, enabling detailed analysis of the ocean depletion factors.

Features

Interactive 3D Plotting: The dashboard utilizes a 3D scatter plot to visualize the relationships between latitude, longitude, CO2 levels, water temperature, and chemical contamination. The plot provides a dynamic exploration of the dataset with hover information for deeper insights.

Customizable Data Filtering: Users can select a specific ocean region and adjust the CO2 level range using a slider to filter the data dynamically. This allows for focused analysis of specific areas and environmental conditions.

Color-Coded Visuals: The 3D plot is color-coded based on water temperature, providing an intuitive visual cue to understand temperature variations. The color scale ranges from pink (lower temperatures) to yellow (medium temperatures), and red (higher temperatures), highlighting temperature patterns across different geographic locations.

Responsive Design: The dashboard is optimized for both local development and deployment on Streamlit Cloud. The responsive design ensures compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
